It seems that... the TV has run out of things for you tonight.

The more you had, the worse it got, and now you have nothing.

You wonder who else out there is watching the static right now.

Will anyone ever see the same static that you do? Or is every moment totally unique?

If you look closely, it's almost as if there are still more things out there, hidden between stations..
