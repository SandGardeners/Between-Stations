Hello can anyone hear me?

I'm having another panic attack.

I don't know how to stop it, I can't stop thinking about them.

Everytime I think I have a grip on things, they slip away again.

My heart is beyond broken.

I am sweating and I am having trouble breathing.

I feel as though there is ice creeping up my spine.

I just wish I could know that someone was listening.

Is there anyone else out there?

I'm so alone.
