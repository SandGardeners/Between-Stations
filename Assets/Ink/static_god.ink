===static_god

The static here seems different to you.

It seems as though it is trying to form an image... a message... a symbol?

There is a warmth to the glow, a happy warmth.

You see within the chaos, a beautiful happiness. Raw emotion and comfort. Between each of these pixels is an infinite space, an infinite chance to make things right.

And suddenly you sink further down, deeper in, beyond the space between the pixels, and that happiness vanishes. You feel cold and alone, and everything is dark. There is absolutely nothing here, nothing to grab on to.

Until you pull back out, and return to how things were.

The static fizzes. You reach for the tuner again.
